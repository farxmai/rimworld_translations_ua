  <ATR_SkyMindRelay.label>SkyMind Relay Tower</ATR_SkyMindRelay.label>
  <ATR_SkyMindRelay.description>This tower acts as a relay for SkyMind-connected devices to communicate and operate. Towers like these are necessary for surrogate or SkyMind operations - this tower has capacity for three continuous device connections.</ATR_SkyMindRelay.description>

  <ATR_SkyMindNetwork.label>SkyMind Network Tower</ATR_SkyMindNetwork.label>
  <ATR_SkyMindNetwork.description>This tower acts as a powerful network host for SkyMind-connected devices to communicate and operate. Towers like these are necessary for surrogate or SkyMind operations - this tower has capacity for fifteen continuous device connections.</ATR_SkyMindNetwork.description>
