  <ATR_SkyMindReceiver.description>A small module that can be implanted into an organic brain to completely override the subject's neural network, converting them into a blank husk to be controlled by an external force. Due to the complexity of the device and the inherent difficulty of controlling organic matter, this device has a tendency to combust violently upon destruction. \n\nMany forces have used this to their advantage to destroy surrogates rather than let them fall into enemy hands.</ATR_SkyMindReceiver.description>
