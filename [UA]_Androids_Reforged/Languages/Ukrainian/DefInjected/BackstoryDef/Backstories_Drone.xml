  <ATR_MechChildhoodAncientDroneSoldier.baseDesc>Assembled, by archotechs, seemingly very long ago, with no knowledge of {PAWN_possessive} origin or purpose remaining. {PAWN_pronoun} certainly only seems built for warfare, though. What use could Archotechs have had for {PAWN_objective}?</ATR_MechChildhoodAncientDroneSoldier.baseDesc>

  <ATR_MechChildhoodDrone.baseDesc>Drone "childhoods" are as uninteresting as they are often forgotten. Many creators don't bother marking the moment of awakening, and no drone knows its own history.</ATR_MechChildhoodDrone.baseDesc>

  <ATR_MechAdulthoodAncientDroneSoldier.baseDesc>{PAWN_nameDef} is a drone that has only ever been capable of warfighting. Bugs, mechanoids, rebels, empires, none of it matters. Drones don't care who they fight, and they don't remember who they've killed.</ATR_MechAdulthoodAncientDroneSoldier.baseDesc>

  <ATR_MechAdulthoodDrone.baseDesc>{PAWN_nameDef} is a drone that continues to serve based on {PAWN_possessive} programming. There's no way of knowing how many times that programming has changed, but the drone does not seem bothered by this.</ATR_MechAdulthoodDrone.baseDesc>
