  <ATR_AlertServerHeatCritical>Heat Sensitive Device Critical</ATR_AlertServerHeatCritical>
  <ATR_AlertServerHeatCriticalDesc>At least one heat sensitive device is in danger of combusting due to surpassing its maximum safety heat threshold! Action is required to retain network integrity!</ATR_AlertServerHeatCriticalDesc>

  <ATR_AlertFullSkillServers>Full Skill Servers</ATR_AlertFullSkillServers>
  <ATR_AlertFullSkillServersDesc>There is no more capacity for skill points. Consider using them, or expanding capacity.</ATR_AlertFullSkillServersDesc>

  <ATR_AlertFullHackingServers>Full Hacking Servers</ATR_AlertFullHackingServers>
  <ATR_AlertFullHackingServersDesc>There is no more capacity for hacking points and there is no current time penalty. Consider using them, or expanding capacity.</ATR_AlertFullHackingServersDesc>

  <ATR_AlertLowSecurity>Network At Risk</ATR_AlertLowSecurity>
  <ATR_AlertLowSecurityDesc>The number of available security points is exceedingly unlikely to successfully defend against any attempted hacks! Additional security servers and points are required - extreme caution should be practiced around network use at this time.</ATR_AlertLowSecurityDesc>

  <ATR_NeedMechanicDesc>These mechanical units need repairs, but you have no healthy colonists assigned as mechanics.\n\n{0}\nAssign a healthy colonist to the Mechanic work type. While most damage will naturally be mitigated over time, mechanics will significantly increase recovery speed and reduce the chance of side-effects.</ATR_NeedMechanicDesc>
